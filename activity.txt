The favorite place that i have visited is Tharparker. The beautiful mountains with water sliding down and the peacocks on the road are something to make your journey pleasant already. This can be the most underrated place in the world.
This place is located in the south of the province on Sindh in Pakistan.
This also touches the indian border.
